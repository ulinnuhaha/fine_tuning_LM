## Fine-tuning
In this code we use API key from TogetherAI to run the fine-tuned model of Llama.
To set the API key, Set TAI_API_KEY environment variables before running the script.
```
export TAI_API_KEY="your_tai_api_key"
```
Here, we use Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-Reference version of LLama
To change the API provider and the LLMs version of Llama you can go to:
```
FTModel.py
```
